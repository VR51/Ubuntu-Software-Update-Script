# Ubuntu Software Update Script
Simple Bash script to sit on the desktop. When clicked, the update.sh script runs apt-get update, upgrade and clean.

* You only need to download update.sh
* I keep the script on my desktop so I can click it any time I want to check and install software updates.

# Why?
Because opening a terminal to run updates is too much hassle and I'm too lazy to use GUI options.
